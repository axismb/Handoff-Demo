# iOS 8 - Handoff Demo - Apple Watch-to-iPhone Handoff.
Demo iOS/AppleWatch App for using iOS 8 Handoff API in Xamarin/C#.

Handoff is a great way for users to start an "activity" on their Apple Watch or other iOS device, 
then continue said activity on your parent app on their main iOS device. 

# How This Example Works
1. Deploy iOS & WatchKit app onto a paired iOS device & Apple Watch. 
2. Launch the demo app on your Apple Watch, and select any car on the menu.
3. Without moving away from the details screen, look on your iOS device's homescreen. 
4. Touch and slide the app icon on the bottom left. 
5. It'll open the parent app and show a UIAlertView of what car you were "viewing" on the Apple Watch.
